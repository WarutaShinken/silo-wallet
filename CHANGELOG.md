# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). Since this is a simple fork of a Python program, I will be using integer versions rather than semantic ones. I will also be archiving each version into a branch instead of using releases.
